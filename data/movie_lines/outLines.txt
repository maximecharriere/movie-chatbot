 This floor's freezing.+++$+++ Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?+++$+++ Would you, Sir?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.+++$+++ Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?+++$+++ Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Movement!+++$+++ Position?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Position?+++$+++ Can't lock up...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Can't lock up...+++$+++ Talk to me, Hudson.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Talk to me, Hudson.+++$+++ Uh, seems to be in front and behind.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 ...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.+++$+++ Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Okay, let's do it.+++$+++ Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.+++$+++ Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.+++$+++ Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.+++$+++ Let's go.  Pull 'em out.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.+++$+++ Say again?  All after incinerators?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ APONE 
 I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.+++$+++ Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.+++$+++ Yes.  That follows.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 Yes.  That follows.+++$+++ But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.+++$+++ That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization.

 You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?+++$+++ Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP

 Could it be intelligent?+++$+++ Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.+++$+++ How long until it blows?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 How long until it blows?+++$+++ I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 And it's too late to shut it down?+++$+++ I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 I'll go.+++$+++ What?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 What?+++$+++ I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.+++$+++ All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 It's going to be closer.  You better get going.+++$+++ See you soon.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 HOW MUCH TIME?+++$+++ PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!+++$+++ WE'RE NOT LEAVING!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Ripley...+++$+++ She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.+++$+++ In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 You did okay, Bishop.+++$+++ Well, thanks, I --+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BISHOP 
 Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...+++$+++ You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Have they located my daughter yet?+++$+++ Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Is she...?+++$+++ Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Amy.+++$+++ Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.+++$+++ Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...+++$+++ I get the picture.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 I get the picture.+++$+++ Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.+++$+++ They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.+++$+++ You are a head case.  Have a donut.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 No.  There's no way!+++$+++ Hear me out...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Hear me out...+++$+++ I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 What about you?  What's your interest in this?+++$+++ Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.+++$+++ I heard you were working in the cargo docks.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 I heard you were working in the cargo docks.+++$+++ That's right.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 That's right.+++$+++ Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?+++$+++ It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.+++$+++ What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?+++$+++ If I go.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 If I go.+++$+++ If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...+++$+++ Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...+++$+++ No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...+++$+++ Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.+++$+++ That's the plan.  My word on it.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?+++$+++ Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 I hope you're right.  I really do.+++$+++ I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 That the atmosphere processor?+++$+++ Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 They're right under the primary heat exchangers.+++$+++ Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...+++$+++ That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.+++$+++ She's right.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.+++$+++ Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.+++$+++ Why not?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --+++$+++ They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?+++$+++ This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --+++$+++ Bullshit!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 You son of a bitch.+++$+++ Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.+++$+++ What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.+++$+++ Corporal Hicks!?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Corporal Hicks!?+++$+++ This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.+++$+++ You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.+++$+++ You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.+++$+++ But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --+++$+++ Now, wait a second --+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 Now, wait a second --+++$+++ You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?+++$+++ Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.+++$+++ Sorry to disappoint you.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.+++$+++ You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.+++$+++ These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?+++$+++ We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Still nothing from the colony?+++$+++ Dead on all channels.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.+++$+++ It's insured.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ BURKE 
 What's he scanning for?+++$+++ PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 We're talking thermonuclear explosion.+++$+++ Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?+++$+++ Thirty-eight...simulated.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.+++$+++ The structure seems intact.  They have power.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 One of us?+++$+++ Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Where are your parents?  You have to try...+++$+++ Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 What is it?+++$+++ I don't know.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 I don't know.+++$+++ Proceed inside.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 So.+++$+++ So...then the fusion containment shuts down.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 So...then the fusion containment shuts down.+++$+++ So?  So?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!+++$+++ Shut up.  Just shut up!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 I told them to fall back...+++$+++ They're but off!  Do something!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 How do you feel?+++$+++ All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...+++$+++ Forget it.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...+++$+++ Sir?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Sir?+++$+++ Yes, Hicks?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Yes, Hicks?+++$+++ Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.+++$+++ What's the question?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 What's the question?+++$+++ Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?+++$+++ All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Are there any questions?  Hudson?+++$+++ How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...+++$+++ ...We're coming in.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 ...We're coming in.+++$+++ He's coming in.  I feel safer already.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Sir, the CPU is on-line.+++$+++ Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.+++$+++ Alive?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ GORMAN 
 Alive?+++$+++ Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 We're not making that out too well.  What is it?+++$+++ You tell me.  I only work here.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Save it.+++$+++ Sure, Hicks.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Let's get the fuck out of here!+++$+++ Not that tunnel, the other one!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!+++$+++ Are you finished?  You okay?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.+++$+++ Aye-firmative.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 We got problems.+++$+++ I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Maybe we got 'em demoralized.+++$+++ I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 The corner!  Ready?+++$+++ Do it!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Seventeen meters.+++$+++ Let's get these things lit.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Well you're not reading it right!+++$+++ Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Let's go!  Let's go!+++$+++ Fuckin' A!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.+++$+++ Poor bastard.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?+++$+++ About seventeen days.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.+++$+++ We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.+++$+++ That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 They're in the approach corridor.+++$+++ On my way.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Now many?+++$+++ Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Newt time then can walk right up and knock.+++$+++ But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 They'll get us.+++$+++ Maybe.  Maybe not.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Maybe.  Maybe not.+++$+++ Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?+++$+++ If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 What's this?+++$+++ Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.+++$+++ Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.+++$+++ Yeah.  I've noticed.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.+++$+++ The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.+++$+++ Let's waste him.  No offense.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 It's game time.+++$+++ Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.+++$+++ We didn't miss anything.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Locked.+++$+++ Stand back.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --+++$+++ All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Hicks, don't let him leave.+++$+++ We ain't going anywhere.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Ellen.+++$+++ Don't be long, Ellen.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HICKS 
 Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?+++$+++ No.  Have you?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ VASQUEZ 
 Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.+++$+++ Fuck you.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ VASQUEZ 
 Fuck you.+++$+++ Anytime.  Anywhere.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?+++$+++ Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.+++$+++ Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!+++$+++ Hudson, give us a break.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ VASQUEZ 
 It's inside the complex.+++$+++ You're just reading me.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ VASQUEZ 
 You're just reading me.+++$+++ No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON

 Looks like it stung him.+++$+++ Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.+++$+++ Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...+++$+++ She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.+++$+++ Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Thanks.+++$+++ Uh, what's next?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.+++$+++ How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.+++$+++ I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.+++$+++ Think of what?  We're fucked.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 Think of what?  We're fucked.+++$+++ What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.+++$+++ Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 They cut the power.+++$+++ What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...+++$+++ Just get back here!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Range twenty meters.+++$+++ Seal the door.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Fifteen meters.+++$+++ I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.+++$+++ They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Nine meters.  Eight.+++$+++ Can't be.  That's inside the room!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ RIPLEY 
 Can't be.  That's inside the room!+++$+++ It's readin' right.  Look!+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ HUDSON 
 You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?+++$+++ Yeah.  What?+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ SIMPSON 
 Yeah.  What?+++$+++ There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.+++$+++ aliens +++$+++ LYDECKER

I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day.

 Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.+++$+++ Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...+++$+++ That we should take our friendship a little further?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 That we should take our friendship a little further?+++$+++ Yes...+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ BUDDY

 Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.+++$+++ Well... okay... but only as a friend.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY

 There's something I really want to share with you.+++$+++ There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...+++$+++ Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY

 I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.+++$+++ Then what are we going to do?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Then what are we going to do?+++$+++ You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ BUDDY 
 You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...+++$+++ That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.+++$+++ Let's get a hot dog.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ BUDDY 
 Hey, look out, a bee!+++$+++ Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY

 So, whatever happened to her?+++$+++ She killed herself a week before he died.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Let her go, Cin.+++$+++ But he'll kill her!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 But he'll kill her!+++$+++ That means more screen time for us.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ THEO 
 I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...+++$+++ It's okay.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ RAY 
 It's okay.+++$+++ Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY

 Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.+++$+++ Both of them?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Both of them?+++$+++ Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ HANSON 
 Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.+++$+++ This can't be happening?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 This can't be happening?+++$+++ Now you'll be mine, Cindy.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ HANSON 
 Noooo!!!+++$+++ Yes!!!!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ HANSON 
 Would you like me to help you pass them back?+++$+++ I don't need your help.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT

 He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.+++$+++ Quick, everyone to the lab.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 What are we gonna do?+++$+++ We have to destroy him.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.+++$+++ I'll go.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.+++$+++ Alright, let's take a vote...+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Father!+++$+++ My child, you're alive!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ MCFEELY 
 My child, you're alive!+++$+++ Yes, we made it!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY

 I'm sorry.+++$+++ Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY

 So, do you think you made it into the class?+++$+++ I don't know, but I sure hope so.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 I don't know, but I sure hope so.+++$+++ You could use the grade, huh?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 You could use the grade, huh?+++$+++ Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?+++$+++ Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.+++$+++ Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.+++$+++ Huh?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Huh?+++$+++ Gear. You know, clothing.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Gear. You know, clothing.+++$+++ Oh.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Oh.+++$+++ Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...+++$+++ Now you gotta learn the correct slang.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Yo! That jacket is tight.+++$+++ Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!+++$+++ Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!+++$+++ Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Am I cool now?+++$+++ Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Aww, the little bird died.+++$+++ Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.+++$+++ Hey, I got an idea.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 That was a great idea, Shorty.+++$+++ I told you it would taste just like chicken.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Did you do that?+++$+++ Uh, uh.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Uh, uh.+++$+++ You better go get Dwight and the Professor.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.+++$+++ I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.+++$+++ Are you?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Are you?+++$+++ That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Hey, y'all! What's going on?+++$+++ Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?+++$+++ That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ SHORTY 
 Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?+++$+++ Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Professor, what's the history of this house?+++$+++ I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Alright, Cindy, what's so important?+++$+++ Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?+++$+++ It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.+++$+++ Got my camera right here.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 I got it!+++$+++ That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 I'm telling you, it was possessed.+++$+++ Theo, did you see the animal?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.+++$+++ What are you getting at, Professor?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 What are you getting at, Professor?+++$+++ Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.+++$+++ There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 Got a problem with that?+++$+++ Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 I take it you're not mad at me.+++$+++ I wouldn't go that far.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 I don't like this, this...+++$+++ Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 I think she's starting to suspect something?+++$+++ Who?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.+++$+++ Saw who?!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Saw who?!+++$+++ Don't touch me!!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ CINDY 
 I finished all the interviews.+++$+++ Let me see the files.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Let me see the files.+++$+++ They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Let me help you.+++$+++ I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Here you go, Professor.+++$+++ Are these all the subjects?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.+++$+++ Any of them hot?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.+++$+++ Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.+++$+++ As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.+++$+++ Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.+++$+++ Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.+++$+++ Willing? I like that.  And, this one?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Willing? I like that.  And, this one?+++$+++ That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.+++$+++ What's this?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?+++$+++ They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.+++$+++ Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.+++$+++ How are we going to get them all up there?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 How are we going to get them all up there?+++$+++ I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.+++$+++ And what happens when all hell breaks loose?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 And what happens when all hell breaks loose?+++$+++ We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?+++$+++ In about fifteen minutes.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 In about fifteen minutes.+++$+++ Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.+++$+++ Right. What about condoms?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Right. What about condoms?+++$+++ Professor!+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Professor!+++$+++ Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.+++$+++ Would you please focus?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Would you please focus?+++$+++ Fine.  What's all this stuff?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Fine.  What's all this stuff?+++$+++ Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Are those cameras all throughout the house?+++$+++ Yes, I thought that it would be best.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Yes, I thought that it would be best.+++$+++ Even in the bathroom?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?+++$+++ That one.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 That one.+++$+++ After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.+++$+++ Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.+++$+++ Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.+++$+++ Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 My God! Is she dead?+++$+++ No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Professor, I think you should see this.+++$+++ What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?+++$+++ No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 The image there.+++$+++ Are you sure it's not the tape?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Are you sure it's not the tape?+++$+++ I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.+++$+++ Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 What the hell?!+++$+++ It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Professor, we need to talk.+++$+++ What is it, Dwight?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 What is it, Dwight?+++$+++ I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.+++$+++ What?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 What?+++$+++ The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.+++$+++ That's why we came here, remember?+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 That's why we came here, remember?+++$+++ Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.+++$+++ Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 I can do it myself.+++$+++ Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ PROFESSOR 
 Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.+++$+++ The keys. She took the keys.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Hello Dwight.+++$+++ Hi.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 What are you working on?+++$+++ Just a little experiment.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?+++$+++ Well, there's a lot riding on this project.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.+++$+++ You do.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 You do.+++$+++ That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ THEO 
 That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.+++$+++ And sexy.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ DWIGHT 
 And sexy.+++$+++ Of course. So sexy.+++$+++ scary movie 2 +++$+++ THEO

 Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--+++$+++ There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ ROZ 
 Toxic dumps, huh.+++$+++ And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ ROZ

 Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.+++$+++ I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK 
 What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.+++$+++ This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK 
 You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.+++$+++ I don't care.  Cretin.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK 
 That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.+++$+++ No!+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK 
 Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering� the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron�+++$+++ I will finish what I've begun�+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK

 Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.+++$+++ Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ ROZ 
 No.  No thank you.  I have work.+++$+++ I heard about Thorkel's order--+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ ROZ 
 I heard about Thorkel's order--+++$+++ I left a paper in my desk.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK 
 A bit melodramatic� but if you could prove it� that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--+++$+++ Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK

 All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.+++$+++ You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK 
 Creation? Or its opposite?+++$+++ Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK 
 Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--+++$+++ I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK

 My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!+++$+++ Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...+++$+++ spider-man +++$+++ OCK

 You mean man...+++$+++ To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point.

 Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.+++$+++ Why's that?+++$+++ star trek iv: the voyage home +++$+++ KIRK

 What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.+++$+++ It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?+++$+++ star trek iv: the voyage home +++$+++ GILLIAN 
 No, ma'am. No dipshit.+++$+++ Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.+++$+++ star trek iv: the voyage home +++$+++ GILLIAN

 You feign ignorance?+++$+++ WHAT HAPPENED?+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ KIRK 
 WHAT HAPPENED?+++$+++ You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ CHANG 
 He's a DOCTOR!+++$+++ How can I trust --+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ CHANG

 And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.+++$+++ That isn't true...!+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ KIRK 
 That isn't true...!+++$+++ That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.

 Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --+++$+++ Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ KIRK

 You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...+++$+++ What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ CHEKOV 
 What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?+++$+++ You tell them, Lieutenant.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ SPOCK

 Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...+++$+++ Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity.

 You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.+++$+++ She programmed the torpedo hits?+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ CHEKOV 
 Aye, sir.+++$+++ Mr. Valtane, any more data?+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ SULU

 We don't get many presidential assassins.+++$+++ We didn't kill Gorkon.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ KIRK 
 We didn't kill Gorkon.+++$+++ Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ MARTIA 
 How much time's left of your sentence?+++$+++ Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ MARTIA 
 That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.+++$+++ Anything else you want to tell me?+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ KIRK 
 When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.+++$+++ There's gotta be a way out of this place...+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ KIRK

 And if they're still in place?+++$+++ Then someone forged a data bank entry.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ SPOCK 
 They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...+++$+++ That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ SPOCK 
 Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.+++$+++ I know precisely where he'll be.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ SPOCK

 An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.+++$+++ What exactly does that mean?+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ UHURA 
 What exactly does that mean?+++$+++ It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.+++$+++ star trek vi: the undiscovered country +++$+++ SPOCK

 Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.+++$+++ Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ RIKER 
 Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.+++$+++ Agreed.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.+++$+++ She's the most beautiful ship I�ve ever seen.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ RIKER 
 But she's not the Enterprise.+++$+++ I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?+++$+++ Anything.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ RIKER 
 Anything.+++$+++ When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.+++$+++ I intend to.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ RIKER 
 Serving with you has been an honor.+++$+++ The honor was mine. Captain Riker.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.+++$+++ Praetor Shinzon?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 And you're not as we imagined you.+++$+++ No?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Praetor?+++$+++ I've never met a human woman.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?+++$+++ Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.+++$+++ Praetor Shinzon. We�re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Praetor Shinzon. We�re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.+++$+++ Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.+++$+++ I would be interested to know what we are talking about.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I would be interested to know what we are talking about.+++$+++ Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.+++$+++ And the Senate supports you?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 And the Senate supports you?+++$+++ I have dissolved the Senate.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Right now, you�re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?+++$+++ Yes.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Yes.+++$+++ And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.+++$+++ Yes.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Yes.+++$+++ Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?+++$+++ You know I do.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 We need to talk, just you and I.+++$+++ Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.+++$+++ You know I need to verify this.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 You know I need to verify this.+++$+++ I know.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.+++$+++ What happened?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 What happened?+++$+++ As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.+++$+++ You'll acquire a taste for it.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 It's not quite the face you remember.+++$+++ Not quite. I envy the hair- line.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Not quite. I envy the hair- line.+++$+++ A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.+++$+++ Yes. The eyes have it.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Yes. The eyes have it.+++$+++ Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.+++$+++ How did you end up on Remus?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 How did you end up on Remus?+++$+++ They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.+++$+++ You're doing this to liberate the Remans?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 You're doing this to liberate the Remans?+++$+++ No race should be a slave to another.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 You don't trust me.+++$+++ I have no reason to.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I have no reason to.+++$+++ Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you�d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you�d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.+++$+++ And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.+++$+++ All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.+++$+++ There's so much, and so much of it is dull...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 There's so much, and so much of it is dull...+++$+++ Were we always explorers?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Were we always explorers?+++$+++ No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...+++$+++ Looking up at the stars.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Looking up at the stars.+++$+++ Yes.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Yes.+++$+++ And you dreamed about what was up there. About...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 And you dreamed about what was up there. About...+++$+++ New worlds.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 After you, Praetor.+++$+++ Age before rank, Jean Luc.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 So I'm not as tall as you expected?+++$+++ I always hoped I would hit two meters.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I always hoped I would hit two meters.+++$+++ With a full head of hair.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 With a full head of hair.+++$+++ There is that.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.+++$+++ I know.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I know.+++$+++ If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD

 In time, Jean Luc.+++$+++ In time.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Hello, Jean Luc.+++$+++ Why am I here?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Why am I here?+++$+++ I was lonely...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 What are you doing?+++$+++ I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. +++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 All of this so you could capture me?+++$+++ Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I�ll snap its ugly head off.+++$+++ What's this all about?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 What's this all about?+++$+++ It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...+++$+++ You're not Reman.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 You're not Reman.+++$+++ And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?+++$+++ I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.+++$+++ I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.+++$+++ I won't defend my life to you.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I won't defend my life to you.+++$+++ My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?+++$+++ If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.+++$+++ Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.+++$+++ Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?+++$+++ It amazes me how little you know yourself.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 It amazes me how little you know yourself.+++$+++ I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.+++$+++ I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.+++$+++ We are.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 We are.+++$+++ It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.+++$+++ Why are you here?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Why are you here?+++$+++ To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.+++$+++ And what of the Enterprise?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 And what of the Enterprise?+++$+++ I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.+++$+++ You know that's not possible.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 You know that's not possible.+++$+++ I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.+++$+++ Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.+++$+++ Long ago.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Long ago.+++$+++ Not so long.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 Not so long.+++$+++ Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.+++$+++ I see more than what you are.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!+++$+++ He is what his life has made him!+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Yes.+++$+++ So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD

 That's your life... not mine.+++$+++ Please.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD

 It�s too late.+++$+++ You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!+++$+++ I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.+++$+++ I am.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ PICARD 
 I am.+++$+++ Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.+++$+++ On my way.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Report!+++$+++ Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ REMAN OFFICER 
 Target disruptors. Destroy them.+++$+++ Disruptors are off-line, sir.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ REMAN OFFICER

 What about Picard?+++$+++ Our greater goal is more important, brother.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Our greater goal is more important, brother.+++$+++ But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ REMAN OFFICER 
 Well, that sounds relaxing too.+++$+++ It is... invigorating.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ WORF 
 So they�ve got him up and running.+++$+++ He's a very unusual android.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ WORF 
 He's a very unusual android.+++$+++ Runs in the family.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ RIKER 
 My God...+++$+++ Should I raise shields?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ WORF 
 Minimal damage to the Scimitar.+++$+++ Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ RIKER 
 Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.+++$+++ We're being hailed.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ WORF 
 Intruder alert!+++$+++ Let's go.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ RIKER 
 Are we prepared?+++$+++ Yes, Praetor.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ VICEROY 
 This is a mistake.+++$+++ He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON

 Find her again.+++$+++ No -- this is wasting time.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ VICEROY 
 No -- this is wasting time.+++$+++ Do as I tell you!+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.+++$+++ Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 How long?+++$+++ A matter of hours now.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ VICEROY 
 How long until we reach the Rift?+++$+++ Seven minutes.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ VICEROY 
 Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.+++$+++ What?!+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ VICEROY 
 What?!+++$+++ You heard me.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Praetor...+++$+++ FULL STOP AND FIRE !+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 What is it?!! Focus on your job!!+++$+++ She is here.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ VICEROY 
 Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?+++$+++ They're holding position.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SURAN 
 They're holding position.+++$+++ And?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON

 How many Warbirds will you need?+++$+++ None.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.+++$+++ The Scimitar will serve my needs.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 The Scimitar will serve my needs.+++$+++ But surely...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SURAN 
 But surely...+++$+++ I came this far alone ...+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!+++$+++ You don't have to understand.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 You don't have to understand.+++$+++ And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SURAN 
 And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?+++$+++ I have a purpose.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 I have a purpose.+++$+++ Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SURAN 
 Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?+++$+++ Silence, Romulan!+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SHINZON 
 You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard�s whip and you'll soon understand patience.+++$+++ Praetor.+++$+++ star trek: nemesis +++$+++ SURAN

 Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?+++$+++ Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ MINH

 I found it...+++$+++ And?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 And?+++$+++ Drains right into the Central Reservoir.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 Drains right into the Central Reservoir.+++$+++ Get her on-line.  Now!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.+++$+++ Keep trying!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.+++$+++ Shit.  When?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Shit.  When?+++$+++ Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.+++$+++ You win some, you loose some.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 You win some, you loose some.+++$+++ I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?+++$+++ No, but I got something that might interest you.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.+++$+++ Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Where're they headed?+++$+++ We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 When?+++$+++ Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.+++$+++ Can we move it to a different orbit in time?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Picking up velocity.+++$+++ Match it!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 What's going on?+++$+++ The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.+++$+++ Force the door.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 It's too late!+++$+++ Nooooo!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.+++$+++ What's our weapons situation?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.+++$+++ Has anybody talked to them?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Has anybody talked to them?+++$+++ Not yet.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 Not yet.+++$+++ Do it.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Oh, man...+++$+++ Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 How much air-time have I got?+++$+++ About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.+++$+++ Deal.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Deal.+++$+++ We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.+++$+++ But...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ CASSIE 
 C'mon, man.  One more sweep.+++$+++ One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.+++$+++ Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?+++$+++ Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Listen to what?+++$+++ That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 De Vries?+++$+++ Yeah?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 Yeah?+++$+++ Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Something spooking the rhinos?+++$+++ I dunno.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Hey, Guttierez?+++$+++ What?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 What?+++$+++ Take a look at this.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 One of 'em must have escaped.+++$+++ That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.+++$+++ Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.+++$+++ That's a fact.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Whoa, wait a minute...+++$+++ What?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 What?+++$+++ Just got a reading...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?+++$+++ I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.+++$+++ Forget it, man.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 Forget it, man.+++$+++ C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.+++$+++ Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 What the hell are you doing?+++$+++ Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Alright, okay.  Look...+++$+++ What?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 What?+++$+++ I'll come with you.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 But I'm going first...+++$+++ Anything you say, Mammacitta.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Careful of that edging there...+++$+++ Yeah, I got it.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Still got him?+++$+++ It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Hold it, hold it...+++$+++ What's wrong?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 What's wrong?+++$+++ I'm picking up another signal.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 What?  Where?+++$+++ Just behind us, over to the right.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?+++$+++ Yeah, I...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Wait.  Lost it.+++$+++ How?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 How?+++$+++ I dunno.  Might be a glitch.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Oh, man.  That's no glitch!+++$+++ It's alright, it's cool...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 It's alright, it's cool...+++$+++ Is it still moving?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 Is it still moving?+++$+++ No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!+++$+++ Couple more seconds!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DE VRIES 
 Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.+++$+++ Thanks.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 What happened?+++$+++ York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DILLER 
 Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.+++$+++ Where does that lead to?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.+++$+++ Okay.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DILLER 
 Okay.+++$+++ One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.+++$+++ Auto-shop?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?+++$+++ Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DRISCOLL 
 Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.+++$+++ Which mean physically going outside.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Is this the suit?+++$+++ Uh-huh.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ DRISCOLL 
 Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.+++$+++ Sounds great.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.+++$+++ How tight are these shafts?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.+++$+++ What's the problem?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 What's the problem?+++$+++ She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.+++$+++ Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.+++$+++ Appreciate that.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 And...?+++$+++ And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ GUTTIEREZ 
 That's what we thought.+++$+++ Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?+++$+++ Done it already.  Nothing matches.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?+++$+++ Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Already working on it.+++$+++ Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 They've changed their heading again.+++$+++ Compensate!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Compensate!+++$+++ Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...+++$+++ What is that?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.+++$+++ You've checked that end?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.+++$+++ How many... how many people are missing?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 They knocked out the external feeds.+++$+++ Looks like it.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.+++$+++ Well... try the headset.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.+++$+++ What?  Why?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 There's still time to back-out.+++$+++ Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Thanks.+++$+++ Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.+++$+++ Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...+++$+++ Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Okay, we're in business.+++$+++ Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Okay, I'm out of here!+++$+++ Blow those suckers, Driscoll!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.+++$+++ We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.+++$+++ I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.+++$+++ Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.+++$+++ Not too much of the socializing type, then?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Not too much of the socializing type, then?+++$+++ No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.+++$+++ Is that a fact.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Is that a fact.+++$+++ Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.+++$+++ How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?+++$+++ Four.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Four.+++$+++ And before that?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 And before that?+++$+++ Six month stint on Datus.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Six month stint on Datus.+++$+++ Only six?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Only six?+++$+++ What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?+++$+++ Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 What is that?+++$+++ Real man' drink.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Seltzer?+++$+++ Want some?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Any luck raising Ackland's party?+++$+++ Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.+++$+++ First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.+++$+++ 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?+++$+++ Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.+++$+++ Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?+++$+++ There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Yeah.  Somebody won.+++$+++ Check out the tent.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 I've found Ackland!+++$+++ Hold on...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.+++$+++ Agreed.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Agreed.+++$+++ When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.+++$+++ Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.+++$+++ What do you mean?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Think I spoke too soon...+++$+++ Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Do you believe him?+++$+++ Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.+++$+++ Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 So, what do you think?+++$+++ What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 What?+++$+++ I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 That's the wrong way!+++$+++ Detour.  Other way's blocked...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Hurry it up.+++$+++ Don't wait for me!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.+++$+++ What can I do?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 What can I do?+++$+++ I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.+++$+++ I... I can't!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 I... I can't!+++$+++ You have to...+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 You have to...+++$+++ No!+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ HIROKO 
 Where'd you leave them?+++$+++ Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Jesus.+++$+++ Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.+++$+++ Tactical nukes, maybe?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 How's it going?+++$+++ Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.+++$+++ You should hit the sack, too.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 You should hit the sack, too.+++$+++ Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.+++$+++ What time's sundown?+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 What time's sundown?+++$+++ 'Bout five minutes.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS 
 'Bout five minutes.+++$+++ Give me a yell is something happens.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ KAMEN 
 Give me a yell is something happens.+++$+++ You got it, cowboy.+++$+++ alien vs. predator +++$+++ PARSONS

 I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...+++$+++ Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?+++$+++ batman returns +++$+++ ALFRED 
 Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?+++$+++ You'll never guess.+++$+++ batman returns +++$+++ BRUCE

 Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?

 He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.+++$+++ Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED 
 Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.+++$+++ Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.+++$+++ Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED 
 I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.+++$+++ No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ BRUCE

 Is there something wrong, sir?+++$+++ Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?+++$+++ Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED 
 But I can't can I?+++$+++ No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED 
 I am as well as can be expected.+++$+++ Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.+++$+++ I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED 
 Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?+++$+++ Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED

 Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...+++$+++ Yes?+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED 
 I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?+++$+++ Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED 
 I love you, old man.+++$+++ Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.+++$+++ batman and robin +++$+++ ALFRED

 What is that?+++$+++ Photo database. I'll do your photos now.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BATMAN 
 They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.+++$+++ That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.+++$+++ No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BATMAN

 Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.+++$+++ Great.  Give me a grant.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ KNOX 
 Great.  Give me a grant.+++$+++ I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.+++$+++ You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.+++$+++ What is it you want?+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 What is it you want?+++$+++ I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ KNOX 
 I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.+++$+++ I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.+++$+++ Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ KNOX 
 See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.+++$+++ Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?+++$+++ Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ KNOX 
 Do you want a drink?+++$+++ Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?+++$+++ batman +++$+++ KNOX 
 Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?+++$+++ Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?+++$+++ As far as I know.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 As far as I know.+++$+++ Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Do you sail?+++$+++ Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?+++$+++ That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?+++$+++ No.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 No.+++$+++ Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.+++$+++ Odd desire for anyone.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Odd desire for anyone.+++$+++ Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.

 What did you see?+++$+++ ... Terror.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.+++$+++ Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.+++$+++ In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.+++$+++ As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.+++$+++ I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.+++$+++ Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --+++$+++ I'll take you home if you'd like.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE

 God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.+++$+++ Maybe we should just kiss.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Maybe we should just kiss.+++$+++ ... We could try that.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 I don't sing very well.+++$+++ Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.+++$+++ I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.+++$+++ Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 All street mimes should be executed.+++$+++ ... Looks like a convention.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 I know it's late. I -- Are you there?+++$+++ Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --+++$+++ I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE

 Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?+++$+++ I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?+++$+++ No one would miss me.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 No one would miss me.+++$+++ I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.+++$+++ You're one man. You can't save everybody.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ VICKI 
 You're one man. You can't save everybody.+++$+++ What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.+++$+++ Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE

 What now?+++$+++ Hang on. I have to leave a message.+++$+++ batman +++$+++ BRUCE 
 All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.

 We've got to get out of this shower.+++$+++ Now you're making sense.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA

 What are you afraid of?+++$+++ Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.+++$+++ Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.+++$+++ There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA

 Looks like some kind of Mynock.+++$+++ There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN

 Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.+++$+++ Thanks to you.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Thanks to you.+++$+++ That's two you owe me, junior.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 Probe?  What probe?+++$+++ That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 About what?+++$+++ Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 I hope you make your peace with Jabba.+++$+++ Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.+++$+++ No hard feelings?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 No hard feelings?+++$+++ Are you kidding?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Are you kidding?+++$+++ I always said you were a gentleman.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 I always said you were a gentleman.+++$+++ I'll bet.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?+++$+++ Repairs ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 Repairs ...+++$+++ What have you done to my ship?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?+++$+++ Hyperdrive.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 Hyperdrive.+++$+++ I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 How's your mining operation going?+++$+++ Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?+++$+++ Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.+++$+++ I'm sorry too.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 Get out of here, Lando!+++$+++ Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.+++$+++ This ought to be good.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 This ought to be good.+++$+++ Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.+++$+++ He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.+++$+++ Luke?  I don't get it.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?+++$+++ Don't ask me, but he's on his way.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...+++$+++ Yeah, you're a real hero.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ HAN 
 What about Leia and the Wookiee?+++$+++ You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.+++$+++ That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.+++$+++ I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.+++$+++ No.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 No.+++$+++ Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.+++$+++ I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 I'll take what's mine now.+++$+++ Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.+++$+++ That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--+++$+++ I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?+++$+++ You may call me Leia.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Sorry, am I interrupting anything?+++$+++ Not really.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Not really.+++$+++ I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.+++$+++ Thanks.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Thanks.+++$+++ Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.+++$+++ You're part of the mining guild then?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 You're part of the mining guild then?+++$+++ Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 It's a lovely outpost.+++$+++ Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 What about Han?+++$+++ I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...+++$+++ ... we're the bait.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 What's going on?+++$+++ I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.+++$+++ And when do you betray us again?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Look, I stand to lose everything by this.+++$+++ We have no use for your kind.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 We have no use for your kind.+++$+++ This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.+++$+++ There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.+++$+++ You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.+++$+++ Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.+++$+++ What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.+++$+++ Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 We've got to find Luke.+++$+++ His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 What'd you say?+++$+++ I didn't say anything?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.+++$+++ Luke!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Luke!+++$+++ What?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 What?+++$+++ Luke needs help.  We must go back.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 No argument, just do it.  That's a command!+++$+++ Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LANDO 
 Someone's falling.+++$+++ It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 The deflector shields are gone.+++$+++ Are the coordinates set?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.+++$+++ That sounds familiar.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.+++$+++ I understand.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.+++$+++ Is there any chance of them surviving out there?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Is there any chance of them surviving out there?+++$+++ Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ RIEEKAN 
 Have they analyzed the one that was killed?+++$+++ Not yet.  They're working on it now.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ RIEEKAN 
 We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.+++$+++ What is it?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Two transports at a time is awfully risky.+++$+++ We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ RIEEKAN 
 You rest now.+++$+++ So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ THREEPIO 
 So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.+++$+++ I'll be back later.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 You don't have to do this to impress me.+++$+++ If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ THREEPIO 
 Closer?!+++$+++ Closer?!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 A tremor!+++$+++ Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ THREEPIO 
 What??+++$+++ Oh my, no!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ THREEPIO 
 Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.+++$+++ Well, what now?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Rather touchy, aren't they.+++$+++ I thought you knew this person.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...+++$+++ Let's go.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?+++$+++ I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.+++$+++ Me too.  I was afraid.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?+++$+++ What did you say?!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Where are you going?+++$+++ I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...+++$+++ That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?+++$+++ What are you talking about?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 What are you talking about?+++$+++ First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...+++$+++ Han's leaving?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.+++$+++ He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.+++$+++ Jabba the Hutt?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Jabba the Hutt?+++$+++ I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.+++$+++ Snow creatures ... they're here?!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Leia!+++$+++ Luke, no!  It's a trap.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LEIA 
 Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?+++$+++ He'll survive.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 This hyperdrive had better work.+++$+++ I've never seen it fail.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.+++$+++ Why not me?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Why not me?+++$+++ To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 I have followed my feelings.+++$+++ You are reckless!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.+++$+++ You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.+++$+++ I thought I was in good shape.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I thought I was in good shape.+++$+++ Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.+++$+++ No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.+++$+++ Okay.  I'll give it a try.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Okay.  I'll give it a try.+++$+++ No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 I can't. It's too big.+++$+++ Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 I don't believe it.+++$+++ That is why you fail.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.+++$+++ I thought those seekers were set for stun!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I thought those seekers were set for stun!+++$+++ That they are.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 That they are.+++$+++ They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.+++$+++ That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.+++$+++ But I feel The Force flowing!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 But I feel The Force flowing!+++$+++ Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Price?  What do you mean?+++$+++ The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.+++$+++ Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?+++$+++ No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.+++$+++ But how am I to know the good side from the dark?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 But how am I to know the good side from the dark?+++$+++ You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.+++$+++ But tell me why ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 But tell me why ...+++$+++ No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Four this time!  The Force you feel.+++$+++ Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I feel cold.+++$+++ This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.+++$+++ What's in there?+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 What's in there?+++$+++ Only what you take with you.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Ben?  Ben?+++$+++ Free your mind and return he will.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Free your mind and return he will.+++$+++ My mind fills with so many images.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 My mind fills with so many images.+++$+++ Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.+++$+++ I see a city in the clouds.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I see a city in the clouds.+++$+++ Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.+++$+++ I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.+++$+++ It is the future you see.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Will they die?+++$+++ Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 They're my friends.+++$+++ Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?+++$+++ I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 And sacrifice Han and Leia?+++$+++ If it must be.  Yes.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ YODA 
 The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.+++$+++ You'll find I'm full of surprises.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 You'll find I'm full of surprises.+++$+++ And I too.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.+++$+++ No!+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 No!+++$+++ There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.+++$+++ I'll die first.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 I'll die first.+++$+++ That won't be necessary.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER 
 All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.+++$+++ Time will tell.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.+++$+++ No! .... Never ....+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!+++$+++ Never.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ LUKE 
 The Hoth System?+++$+++ Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ PIETT 
 Yes, My Lord.+++$+++ Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.+++$+++ star wars: the empire strikes back +++$+++ VADER

 Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.+++$+++ Hiding?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 What honey?+++$+++ Fuck it.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ BURKE 
 Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.+++$+++ And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CARDINAL 
 And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?+++$+++ How about Lankaster Merrin.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ PRESIDENT 
 How about Lankaster Merrin.+++$+++ Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CARDINAL 
 Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.+++$+++ That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ PRESIDENT

 No, he's working on another book.+++$+++ Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CARDINAL 
 Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?+++$+++ It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ PRESIDENT 
 It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.+++$+++ I didn't know that.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CARDINAL 
 I didn't know that.+++$+++ Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ PRESIDENT

 Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.+++$+++ Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!+++$+++ It's-+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CLINIC DIRECTOR 
 It's-+++$+++ And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!+++$+++ I'm sorry.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CLINIC DIRECTOR 
 I'm sorry.+++$+++ You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.+++$+++ You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Hello?+++$+++ In here!+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON 
 Hi+++$+++ Hi, how'd your day go?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON

 Dinner at the White House.+++$+++ Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?+++$+++ Just five or six people.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON 
 Just five or six people.+++$+++ No kidding.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.+++$+++ Maybe the circuit is busy?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON 
 Maybe the circuit is busy?+++$+++ Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS

 What did the doctor say?+++$+++ We have to start looking for a shrink.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Oh Burke! Poor Burke!+++$+++ I can't believe it.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON 
 This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?+++$+++ Of course I didn't.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON 
 Where do you want this?+++$+++ What is it?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 What is it?+++$+++ Phonograph.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON

 I'm gonna miss you.+++$+++ Me too.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ SHARON

 Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?+++$+++ No, she was heavily sedated.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 No, she was heavily sedated.+++$+++ It's serious?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 It's serious?+++$+++ Yes, I'm affraid it is.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Yes, I'm affraid it is.+++$+++ May I ask...?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 May I ask...?+++$+++ We still don't know.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 We still don't know.+++$+++ Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?+++$+++ No. Not at all,+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 No. Not at all,+++$+++ You were expecting a deliver y that day?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 You were expecting a deliver y that day?+++$+++ Not that I know of.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS

 Groceries maybe? A package?+++$+++ I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.+++$+++ Oh, I see.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 Oh, I see.+++$+++ Want to ask him?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Want to ask him?+++$+++ Never mind.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 Would you like some more coffee?+++$+++ Please.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?+++$+++ Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.+++$+++ I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?+++$+++ When she's well enough, I'll ask.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 When she's well enough, I'll ask.+++$+++ Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ KINDERMAN 
 I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?+++$+++ Of course. Have you got a pen?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 Oh, she'd love it.+++$+++ What's her name?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS 
 I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.+++$+++ Really? wow.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS

 Good morning Madame.+++$+++ Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS

 A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.+++$+++ Why the math?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS

 Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.+++$+++ Convulsion?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS

 Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance.

 There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.+++$+++ So what's next?+++$+++ the exorcist +++$+++ CHRIS

 What do you want me to do?+++$+++ I mean -- for a living.+++$+++ fight club +++$+++ JACK 
 I mean -- for a living.+++$+++ Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?+++$+++ fight club +++$+++ TYLER

 Do you still want to meet?+++$+++ ... Yes.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 ... Yes.+++$+++ Go the the Adams Street bridge.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.+++$+++ It's an honor.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 It's an honor.+++$+++ Please.  Come.  Sit.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?+++$+++ You could say that.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 You could say that.+++$+++ I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?+++$+++ You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO

 Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?+++$+++ The Matrix?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 The Matrix?+++$+++ Do you want to know what it is?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.+++$+++ What truth?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What truth?+++$+++ That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.+++$+++ What does that mean?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?+++$+++ This can't be...+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 This can't be...+++$+++ Be what?  Be real?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 ... am I dead?+++$+++ Far from it.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS

 Why do my eyes hurt?+++$+++ You've never used them before.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?+++$+++ More important than what is when?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 More important than what is when?+++$+++ When?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 When?+++$+++ You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Right now, we're inside a computer program?+++$+++ Wild, isn't it?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 This isn't real?+++$+++ What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.+++$+++ A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?+++$+++ Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!+++$+++ I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Get some rest.  You're going to need it.+++$+++ For what?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 For what?+++$+++ Your training.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 This is incredible.  I know kung fu.+++$+++ Show me.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 How did I beat you?+++$+++ You -- you're too fast.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 You -- you're too fast.+++$+++ Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 I know what you're trying to do --+++$+++ I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Do you know why you didn't make it?+++$+++ Because... I didn't think I would?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 I thought it wasn't real.+++$+++ Your mind makes it real.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?+++$+++ The body cannot live without the mind.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.+++$+++ What -- what lesson?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Do you understand, Neo?+++$+++ I think I do.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 I think I do.+++$+++ No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?+++$+++ Yeah.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Yeah.+++$+++ Look again.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.+++$+++ How?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 How?+++$+++ I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?+++$+++ No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Set down in there.+++$+++ What's going on?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?+++$+++ Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.+++$+++ The beginning?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 The beginning?+++$+++ Of the Resistance.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Of the Resistance.+++$+++ And she knows what?  Everything?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 And she knows what?  Everything?+++$+++ She would say she knows enough.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 She would say she knows enough.+++$+++ How does she know?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 How does she know?+++$+++ She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.+++$+++ And she's never wrong.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 And she's never wrong.+++$+++ Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.+++$+++ She helped you?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 She helped you?+++$+++ Yes.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Yes.+++$+++ What did she tell you?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What did she tell you?+++$+++ That I would find the One.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.+++$+++ Why?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Why?+++$+++ I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?+++$+++ What do you believe in?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 What do you believe in?+++$+++ What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.+++$+++ That's why we're here.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 That's why we're here.+++$+++ Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?+++$+++ Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.+++$+++ And you still believe I'm the One?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 And you still believe I'm the One?+++$+++ Yes I do.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Yes I do.+++$+++ Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Did you believe in them too?+++$+++ No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.+++$+++ Morpheus, I don't know --+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Morpheus, I don't know --+++$+++ I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!+++$+++ Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --+++$+++ She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 How is he?+++$+++ Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TANK 
 Got it.+++$+++ I need the main wet-wall.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Now left and that's it in front of you.+++$+++ Good.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 Tank.+++$+++ Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TANK 
 Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!+++$+++ We need an exit.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS 
 We need an exit.+++$+++ Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TANK 
 Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.+++$+++ We're on our way --+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ MORPHEUS

 You're the Oracle?+++$+++ Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?+++$+++ Yeah.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Yeah.+++$+++ I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.+++$+++ What vase?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 That vase.+++$+++ Shit, I'm sorry.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.+++$+++ How did you know...?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.+++$+++ Who?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Who?+++$+++ Not too bright though.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?+++$+++ Honestly?  I don't know.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --+++$+++ But what?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 But what?+++$+++ But you already know what I'm going to tell you.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 But you already know what I'm going to tell you.+++$+++ I'm not the One.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 I'm not the One.+++$+++ Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.+++$+++ What?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What?+++$+++ Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 What's funny?+++$+++ Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.+++$+++ I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.+++$+++ What do you mean, without him?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.+++$+++ What?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What?+++$+++ You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ ORACLE 
 Hello, Neo.+++$+++ How do you know that name?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 How do you know that name?+++$+++ I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.+++$+++ Who are you?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Who are you?+++$+++ My name is Trinity.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 My name is Trinity.+++$+++ Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?+++$+++ That was a long time ago.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 That was a long time ago.+++$+++ Gee-zus.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO

 Do you want to go somewhere and talk?+++$+++ No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 How did you do that?+++$+++ Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.+++$+++ Of what?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO

 They're watching you, Neo.+++$+++ Who is?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Who is?+++$+++ Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.+++$+++ What is the Matrix?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What is the Matrix?+++$+++ When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 What the hell is this?!+++$+++ It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.+++$+++ From what?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 From what?+++$+++ From you.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 Neo, please, you have to trust me.+++$+++ Why?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Why?+++$+++ Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 And I know that's not where you want to be.+++$+++ ... shit.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What is this thing?+++$+++ We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 Uh-oh...+++$+++ It's going into replication.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 Get this thing out of me!+++$+++ Easy, Neo.  Easy.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.+++$+++ It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 God...+++$+++ What?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 What?+++$+++ I used to eat there... Really good noodles.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What does that mean?+++$+++ That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.+++$+++ But an Oracle can.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 But an Oracle can.+++$+++ That's different.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 That's different.+++$+++ Is it?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Is it?+++$+++ Are you worried?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 Are you worried?+++$+++ Should I be?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Should I be?+++$+++ No.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 Did you go to her?+++$+++ Yes.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 Yes.+++$+++ What did she tell you?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO

 Are you all right?+++$+++ ... right as rain.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What did you just say?+++$+++ Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.+++$+++ What happened?  What did you see?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 What happened?  What did you see?+++$+++ A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.+++$+++ How much like it?  Was it the same cat?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 How much like it?  Was it the same cat?+++$+++ It might have been.  I'm not sure.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What is it?+++$+++ A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY

 Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!+++$+++ There has to be something that we can do.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO

 What are you doing?+++$+++ I'm going in after him.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 I'm going in after him.+++$+++ You can't!+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY

 What?+++$+++ I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 No, you... have to be.+++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.+++$+++ No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.+++$+++ Why?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO

 What?+++$+++ I believe I can bring him back.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What are you doing?+++$+++ I'm coming with you.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY 
 I'm coming with you.+++$+++ No, you're not.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 No, you're not.+++$+++ No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TRINITY

 The last human city.  The only place we got left.+++$+++ Where is it?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO

 They're hacking his mind.+++$+++ How?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 How?+++$+++ They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TANK 
 They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.+++$+++ How much time?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 How much time?+++$+++ Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TANK 
 When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.+++$+++ What do they want?+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ NEO 
 What do they want?+++$+++ Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.+++$+++ the matrix +++$+++ TANK

 Twice.+++$+++ What did you think of him?+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK 
 What did you think of him?+++$+++ You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ ETHAN 
 You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?+++$+++ Not necessarily.+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK 
 So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.+++$+++ Then you do think it was Ambrose.+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK 
 Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.+++$+++ Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK 
 Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.+++$+++ The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK 
 Right now only Ambrose knows that.+++$+++ In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK 
 In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.+++$+++ In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ ETHAN 
 In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.+++$+++ - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK

 You mean that leaves Miss Hall.+++$+++ Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ SWANBECK 
 - good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.+++$+++ She sacrificed herself..+++$+++ mission: impossible ii +++$+++ ETHAN 
 She sacrificed herself..+++$+++ Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.

Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.

This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!+++$+++ Peace, good Mercutio, peace!

 Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.+++$+++ Should we alert the Sith Lords?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ CONTROLLER 
 Should we alert the Sith Lords?+++$+++ I'll make a report later.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ COMMANDER 
 I'll make a report later.+++$+++ As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ CONTROLLER 
 As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.+++$+++ Send one squad up.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ COMMANDER 
 We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.+++$+++ Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ CONTROLLER 
 Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.+++$+++ Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!+++$+++ It could be worse...+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA 
 Here come six more... grid two!+++$+++ Was this trip really necessary?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 There are only three or four left.+++$+++ Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.+++$+++ Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.+++$+++ When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA 
 When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.+++$+++ What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?+++$+++ The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA

Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.+++$+++ We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA 
 We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.+++$+++ Where are you taking us now anyway?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Where are you taking us now anyway?+++$+++ The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA 
 The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.+++$+++ I'd better go see how he's doing.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.+++$+++ Did it occur to you they might find us?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA 
 We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.+++$+++ I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.+++$+++ I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA 
 Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.+++$+++ That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.+++$+++ We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 Who's the pilot?+++$+++ It's automatic.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you...

 You don't believe in the Force?+++$+++ Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 I found it... It's just not there.+++$+++ What are you saying?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...+++$+++ Why?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.+++$+++ All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!+++$+++ Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.+++$+++ Don't you believe it.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Well, I practice a lot...+++$+++ You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?+++$+++ I don't know... I've never fought anyone.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.+++$+++ Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 This isn't going to work.+++$+++ Why didn't you say so before.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 Why didn't you say so before.+++$+++ I think I did.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...+++$+++ Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.+++$+++ See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 I think she's going to be all right.+++$+++ Not if this tunnel deadends.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Is he afraid of the water?+++$+++ No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Watch it!  Move back.+++$+++ Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!+++$+++ Move out of the way!+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 Get to the ship!+++$+++ Come back here... Where are you going?+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.+++$+++ They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.+++$+++ Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...+++$+++ I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ HAN 
 I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.+++$+++ Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...+++$+++ We'll send a squad up.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ INTERCOM VOICE 
 We'll send a squad up.+++$+++ No need, everything's under control.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 No need, everything's under control.+++$+++ With four casualties?!+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ INTERCOM VOICE

 No!...+++$+++ It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ VADER 
 What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?+++$+++ You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LUKE 
 I am Luke Starkiller at your service.+++$+++ There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA 
 Are there medical facilities on Yavin?+++$+++ He'll be well cared for.+++$+++ star wars +++$+++ LEIA

 He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.+++$+++ Why?+++$+++ star trek v: the final frontier +++$+++ KIRK
